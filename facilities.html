                    He first came to Ghana in 1952 as a member of a team of engineers from Sir William Halcrow and
                    Partners who were in charge of the Volta River Project. Prominent among the tasks performed by Len
                    Allen was the delineation of the proposed Volta River Reservoir, and the establishment of a network
                    of permanent river gauges. After completion of Hydro-electric projects in other parts of the world,
                    he later returned to Ghana as the Resident Manager of Acres International Engineering Consultants
                    who were involved in the construction of the Kpong-Akuse Hydro-Electric Plant. During his stay at
                    Akuse, Mr. Allen saw to the planting of fruit trees and the beautification of Akuse.

                    <br>
                    Len Allen finally returned to his home country (Canada) in July 1982, after having been awarded the
                    Grand Medal of Ghana (Civil Division) by the Ghana Government. He received a similar award from the
                    Canadian government. He died on May 4, 1983, in Toronto, Canada. It was in recognition of his
                    services to the School that the library was named after him. There is also the Allen Memorial fund
                    which has been instituted in memory of Len Allen. The fund was established with the contributions
                    and donations made by sympathisers at the memorial service held in honour of Mr. Len Allen in
                    Toronto, Canada. The accruing interest from the fund is used to replenish the stock of literary
                    material in the library. There is also the Len Allen Physical Science Awards Scheme that gives
                    awards to deserving students.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The library is well-stocked with a variety of literature, including textbooks, encyclopedias,
                    periodicals, journals and national dailies, among others. The Library offers Reference and Lending
                    Services to the staff and students of Akosombo International School. However, adults and students
                    from other institutions may be offered Reference services during vacation. The Libraries at Akuse
                    and Aboadze schools are similarly organised.

                <h5> The Book Shop:</h5>
                <p>
                    The department has a Book Shop with satellite ones which offer for sale materials like textbooks,
                    stationery and school uniforms. As much as possible, all students are supplied with government

                </p>
                <h5> Medical Care:</h5>
                <p>
                    The V.R.A. Hospital and the clinics in the VRA townships provide for the medical needs of students.
                    Students at the Boarding House in Akosombo who require medical attention must obtain a chit from
                    their Senior Housemaster/mistress in the morning before leaving for the hospital. A School vehicle
                    conveys students to the hospital. Apart from this, the Parent –Teacher Association (PTA) has
                    purchased a mini-bus to convey students to and from the hospital. Furthermore, the VRA and the
                    Akosombo PTA have provided sick-bays in both the Boys and Girls dormitories where students
                    convalescing could conveniently be isolated
                    and monitored until recovery. The medical expenses of all students who are cared for at the V.R.A.
                    Hospital and clinics are borne by Parents/Guardians. Such expenses are placed as an additional item
                    on the students' bills.
                </p>
                <h5>School Canteens:</h5>
                <p>
                    The VRA and the PTAs have provided canteens on the various campuses where Day students, in
                    particular, and the general student-body could take their meals and snacks during school breaks.
                    Various dishes are sold by vendors upon the recommendations of the Schools’ food committees. Vendors
                    undergo regular medical examination.
                </p>

                <h5> Transport Facilities for Students:</h5>
                <p>
                    All day students resident in Akosombo, Akuse, and Aboadze are transported to and from school every
                    school day. The students who use the bus service pay a user-fee which is worked out and added to
                    their school bills.
                </p>
                <h5> Bus Service at the Beginning, Mid and End of Term:</h5>
                <p>
                    Most boarding students of AIS come to Akosombo from Accra and Tema. During holidays, the school
                    buses take students home to Accra- Tema, and bring them back to school after the mid-term break. at
                    the beginning and end of term. Students are charged for this bus service.
                </p>
                <h5>Excursions/Educational/Pleasure Trips:
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Students who as part of the schools own programmes, go on field trips outside the school are
                    provided transport. Clubs and Societies that plan for educational and excursion trips outside the
                    school as part of their termly programme are required to pay the actual transport fare.
                </p>
                <h5>Insurance:</h5>
                <p>
                    1. Personal Insurance:
                    <br>
                    There is no Personal Insurance Policy covering students while they are at school. Parents/ Guardians
                    can therefore make their own insurance arrangements for their children/wards, as the school is
                    absolved from any responsibility for injury to any pupil/student whilst they are attending or
                    proceeding from school.
                    <br>
                    2. Personal Property:
                    <br>
                    The problem of loss of property which may include personal items occurs in almost every school. The
                    School does not take any responsibility for the loss of such items, and hence does not provide
                    compensation to victims.
